            The earliest known frozen pops date as far back as 1872. Back then,
            a frozen pop was called a Hokey-Pokey.

          <li>Frozen pops are also known as freezer pops, and ice pops.</li>
          <li>
            The world's largest frozen pop was made in 1967 and was 21 feet
            tall.

            Frozen pops have become so POP-ular that a common arts and craft
            item is called a popsicle stick, named after the most famous brand
            of pop.
